You know, I've had a crush on you ever since 2020. But even if you don't express it in the beginning, you will understand. Whatever, I've made many mistakes in life and lost many people, but you never left me alone. For a moment, I thought that loving someone only made me lose people, so I decided that I would never fall in love with you so as not to lose you. But love comes from Allah. Even if I forget to love you for a moment, I can't forget you. Wherever I go, your illusion will never leave me. You are the only reason that old Nafis has the courage to try more and more. I know that I'm not the perfect guy, and maybe I can never be that 100% perfect man, but I promise you that on your birthday, I'll never give up. I promise to always try to keep you happy, dear Saji, my love. I love you so much.                                                                                                                                                                       ",
